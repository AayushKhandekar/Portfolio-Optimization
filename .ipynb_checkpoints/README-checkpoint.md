   - Beta (Measure of Volatality):
     - Measure of volatality (systematic risk) of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole.
     - Beta is used in Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return on asset.
     - Beta coefficient = Covarience(Return of individual stock, return of market) / Variance(Return of market)
     - S&P500 has a beta of 1
    
    - Correlation:
      - Negative correlations may help diversify risk, while positive correlations could indicate co-movement in prices.
