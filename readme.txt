Data Collection: Gather historical price data for a diverse set of assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and any other relevant financial instruments. You'll need daily or higher frequency data for a significant period.

Feature Engineering: Calculate relevant features for each asset that could influence portfolio returns, such as historical returns, volatility, correlations, and any other fundamental or technical indicators.

Data Preparation: Organize the data into a format suitable for analysis, such as a pandas DataFrame. Ensure that the data is cleaned and properly aligned for further processing.

Multiple Regression Analysis: Use multiple regression to estimate the relationship between the returns of the assets in the portfolio and their respective features. This involves regressing the portfolio returns on the features of the individual assets.

Model Selection and Validation: Evaluate the performance of the regression model using appropriate metrics, such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and significance tests for the regression coefficients. Ensure that the model provides a good fit to the data and is statistically robust.

Portfolio Construction: Use the regression results to construct an optimal portfolio allocation. This could involve assigning weights to each asset based on their regression coefficients, with the objective of maximizing portfolio returns or minimizing risk.

Risk Management: Incorporate risk management techniques into the portfolio construction process to control for factors such as volatility, drawdowns, and correlation risk. Consider constraints on portfolio weights, sector exposures, and other risk factors.

Backtesting: Backtest the portfolio optimization strategy using historical data to assess its performance. Evaluate key performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and cumulative returns over different time periods.

Optimization and Refinement: Fine-tune the portfolio optimization strategy based on performance feedback and changing market conditions. Consider adjusting model parameters, rebalancing frequencies, and other optimization techniques to improve portfolio performance.

Implementation and Execution: Implement the optimized portfolio allocation strategy in a live trading environment. Monitor portfolio performance in real-time and make necessary adjustments as market conditions evolve.

Documentation and Reporting: Document the methodology, code, and results comprehensively. Provide clear explanations of the portfolio optimization process and present the findings in a structured format for review and future reference.

# Step 1: Data Collection
# Assuming you have collected historical price data for a set of assets

# Step 2: Feature Engineering
# Calculate relevant features such as returns, volatility, etc.

# Step 3: Data Preparation
# Organize data into a pandas DataFrame

# Step 4: Multiple Regression Analysis
# Example regression using OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method
X = df[['Feature1', 'Feature2', ...]]  # Features matrix
y = df['Portfolio_Returns']  # Target variable
X = sm.add_constant(X)  # Add constant term
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()  # Fit regression model
print(model.summary())  # Display regression summary

# Step 5: Portfolio Construction
# Use regression coefficients to construct portfolio weights
portfolio_weights = model.params[1:]  # Extract coefficients
portfolio_weights /= portfolio_weights.sum()  # Normalize weights

# Step 6: Risk Management
# Apply risk management techniques to control portfolio risk

# Step 7: Backtesting
# Backtest the portfolio optimization strategy using historical data

# Step 8: Optimization and Refinement
# Fine-tune portfolio optimization strategy based on backtest results

Definitions:

1. Beta - It is the measure of volatality (systematic risk) of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole. Beta is used in CAPM which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return on asset.

Beta coefficient = Covarience(Return of individual stock, return of market) / Variance(Return of market) 

S&P500 has a beta of 1

2. Correlation:
Negative correlations may help diversify risk, while positive correlations could indicate co-movement in prices.

Step 1 - 

Step 2 - Feature Engineering:

The following features will be considered in this project:

1. Volatality (Beta) - Done
2. P/E Ratio - Done
3. Correlations between assets in the portfolio - Done
4. Log Returns - done

Step 3 - Data Preparation
