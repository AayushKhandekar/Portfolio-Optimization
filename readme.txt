Doubts / Think about this!?

1. Should I conduct sector wise regression and analysis? Portfolio can be constructed sector wise? - Yes, perform sector wise analysis

2. Do I have to implement Principal Component Analysis if I am not utilising correlation matrix as a feature in regression? - No, PCA is not needed ATM.

3. Can I perform sector-wise analysis and find out the relationships/trends/patterns between sectors? i.e. which sector affects other sectors?

4. regression -> more data points per stock for beta and p/e ratio -> how to calc earnings per share (eps) for p/e ratio?
